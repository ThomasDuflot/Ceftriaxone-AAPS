# **Ceftriaxone AAPS**

## This repository was created to reproduce all results from [Link Paper](https://pages.github.com/). 
## It contains raw data as well as R code, ensuring transparency of the results. In this context, the repository includes:

###  - [Unbound Ceftriaxone Calculator.xlsx](https://github.com/ThomasDuflot/Ceftriaxone-AAPS/blob/main/Unbound%20Ceftriaxone%20Calculator.xlsx): This excel sheet allows to compute the unbound ceftriaxone from total ceftriaxone and albuminemia
  
###  - [External Validation.csv](https://github.com/ThomasDuflot/Ceftriaxone-AAPS/blob/main/External%20Validation.csv): This file corresponds to the prospective study for the external validation. 62 samples from 59 patients were collected allowing determination of total ceftriaxone, albuminemia and unbound ceftriaxone.

###  - [Retrospective Studied Population.csv](https://github.com/ThomasDuflot/Ceftriaxone-AAPS/blob/main/Retrospective%20Studied%20Population.csv): This file contains clinico-biological data extracted from the clinical data warehouse (408 samples from 222 patients)
    
###  - [R Code](https://github.com/ThomasDuflot/Ceftriaxone-AAPS/blob/main/R%20Code): Used for statistical analyses, plots and tables export.</h4>

###  - [Shiny App Code](https://github.com/ThomasDuflot/Ceftriaxone-AAPS/blob/main/ShinyApp%20Free%20Fraction): Code to reproduce a user friendly application to get free fraction and unbound concentration based on total ceftriaxone and albuminemia for all models</h4>
